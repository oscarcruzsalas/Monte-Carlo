# Monte Carlo Risk Simulation for Portfolio Management

## Overview
This project uses Monte Carlo simulations to model portfolio returns
and assess risk using Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR).

## Key Concepts
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Multivariate normal returns
- Portfolio VaR and CVaR
- Correlation and diversification effects

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
The model demonstrates how portfolio risk changes with asset
correlation and allocation, highlighting the benefits of diversification.

## Next Steps
- Stress testing
- Fat-tailed distributions
- Time-varying volatility
